about.text1=In your profile you can save and manage your personal educational data.
about.text2=Only after you have added a profile, the most important functions of the BIRD Wallet will be available to you.
about.text3=Please note that BIRD Wallet can only be used in combination with our project partners at Digital Campus, BIRD or the Nationale Vernetzungsinfrastruktur Digitale Bildung.
about.createProfile=Add profile
about.what=What is the BIRD Wallet?
about.carousel1=The BIRD Wallet is a sort of digital account for your educational data. Store your certificates, grades, course results and other important information in this virtual wallet. Retrieve and share your educational data anytime from your device.
about.carousel2=Using BIRD Wallet, you can create multiple profiles to organize your educational data. This is especially helpful if multiple people want to use the wallet. Fill each profile with different educational data and manage them individually.
about.carousel3=To easily add contacts like education providers, you can scan their QR code from the Digital Campus. This saves time and makes contacting them straightforward. Then share your educational data with an education provider.
about.carousel4=Through the app, you can share messages and data with your contacts. For example, if you share your CV and certificates with an education centre, they can approve you for a course and send you a certificate of attendance.
about.carousel5=For each profile, you can add multiple mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to secure your educational data. That way, you always have a backup in case you lose or break your primary device.
